# react-webpack-babel
My fork of [Simple React Webpack Babel Starter Kit](https://github.com/alicoding/react-webpack-babel)
with Fluxxor as architecture

This is a simple [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/),
[Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/), [Babel](https://babeljs.io/),
[Fluxxor](https://github.com/BinaryMuse/fluxxor)

and Less template with bootstrap (and all its glyphs)

### What's in it?
Just a simple [index.jsx](./index.jsx), [webpack.config.js](./webpack.config.js) and [index.html](./public/index.html) file.

### To run

You can simply run webpack build using this command:

```
> $ npm run build
```

If you want to run with webpack-dev-server simply run this command:

```
> $ npm run dev
```

Please contribute to the project if you think this can be done better in anyway even for this README :)
